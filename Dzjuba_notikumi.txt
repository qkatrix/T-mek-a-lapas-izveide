# JavaScript Events

JavaScript events are actions or occurrences that take place in the browser, which the user can respond to. They are integral to creating dynamic and interactive web applications. Here are some common events with explanations:

1. **click**: This event occurs when an element is clicked. It can be used on any clickable element like buttons or links.
   - Example: A button click to submit a form.

2. **mouseover**: This event occurs when the mouse pointer moves over an element.
   - Example: Displaying a tooltip when hovering over a button.

3. **keydown**: This event occurs when a key is pressed down. It is often used for form inputs and keyboard shortcuts.
   - Example: Capturing user input in a text field.

4. **submit**: This event occurs when a form is submitted. It can be used to validate form data before sending it to the server.
   - Example: Preventing default submission if validation fails.

5. **load**: This event occurs when the whole page is fully loaded. It can be used to execute scripts only after the content is rendered.
   - Example: Initializing a gallery after the images have loaded.
